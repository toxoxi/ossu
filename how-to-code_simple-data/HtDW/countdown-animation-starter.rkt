;; countdown-animation starter.rkt

; 
; PROBLEM:
; 
; Design an animation of a simple countdown. 
; 
; Your program should display a simple countdown, that starts at ten, and
; decreases by one each clock tick until it reaches zero, and stays there.
; 
; To make your countdown progress at a reasonable speed, you can use the 
; rate option to on-tick. If you say, for example, 
; (on-tick advance-countdown 1) then big-bang will wait 1 second between 
; calls to advance-countdown.
; 
; Remember to follow the HtDW recipe! Be sure to do a proper domain 
; analysis before starting to work on the code file.
; 
; Once you are finished the simple version of the program, you can improve
; it by reseting the countdown to ten when you press the spacebar.
